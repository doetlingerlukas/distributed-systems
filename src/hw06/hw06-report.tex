  \section*{Introduction}
  
  	All parts of the homework sheet are completed.\\
  	Introductions on how to run the code can be found below.\\
  	
  \section*{Implementation}
  
    All specifications from the homework-sheet are implemented. Each \texttt{Application.java} and \texttt{Middleware.java} are classes implementing the \texttt{Runnable} interface and represent apllication and middleware. Communication is done with \texttt{Sockets}.\\
    Assuming that the number of messages to be received is known, objects of type \texttt{Message.java} are sent around. A \texttt{Message} also contains a timestamp, therefore an application can get the messages in the right order. After receiving all messages, they are sorted using the timestamp.\\
    My implementation contains a class, which runs everything, \texttt{AutomatedStart.java}. It starts thre applications and their middleware.\\
    
  \section*{Run}
  
    To run the example, simply\\ \textbf{run the main method of the class AutomatedStart.java}.\\
