  \section*{Introduction}
    
    All three parts of the homework sheet are completed.\\
    There is a subsection at the end of every part, which contains information on how to run the code. There is also a sample output of the program given.\\
	
  \section*{Part 1)}
	
    The first part is implemented using three Java classes, which are inside the \texttt{/part1} directory:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{SimpleClient.java} represents a single client thread.
      \item \texttt{SimpleClientExecutor.java}, a class to start and execute client threads.
      \item \texttt{MultithreadedSortingServer.java} represents the server.
    \end{itemize}
    \texttt{SimpleClient.java} implements the \texttt{Runnable} interface and can therefore be started as thread. It has three private variables: \texttt{int port} the servers port, \texttt{String server} the address of the server and \texttt{String toSort} the string the client wants to be sorted by the server. When construction an instance of this class, all variables have to be given. Since it implements the \texttt{Runnable} interface, it has a \texttt{void run()} method, which calls the \texttt{void request()} method. The request method is the main action of the thread. It gets the servers \texttt{Socket} by it's address and port. After that it opens the input/output-streams and calls \texttt{output.writeUTF(toSort)} to write the unsorted string to servers input-stream. Then it waits until the server writes something to the clients input and reads it with \texttt{input.readUTF()}, to print it to the command-line. The client thread ends after that.\\
    \texttt{SimpleClientExecutor.java} is a class to start several clients and also to initiate the remote shut-down of the server. It also has a method \texttt{String getRandomString(int size)}, which creates a random string for a given length of the given alphabet (all letters + numbers). The main method of this class simply generates six instances of the \texttt{SimpleClient} class and starts them as a thread. Every instance is created with a different random string. The class also starts a specific thread, which connects to the server and sends the string \textit{-shutdown-}. This starts the shut-down process on the server side.\\
    \texttt{MultithreadedSortingServer.java} implements the \texttt{Runnable} interface and represents the server. The method \texttt{String sortString(String toSort)} uses Java 8 streams to sort a string. In the main method, this class starts an \texttt{ExecutorService} with a fixed thread-pool. Inside a \texttt{try} it starts a \texttt{ServerSocket} and accepts clients inside a \texttt{while(true)} loop. For each new client, a instance of \texttt{MultithreadedSortingServer} is submitted to thread-pool. This starts a new thread for each client. The \texttt{run()} method invokes the \texttt{reply()} method, which reads the input-stream (to get the clients unsorted string) and sorts the string. Then it writes it to the output.\\
    Although, if the \texttt{string.equals("-shutdown-")}, the request-handling thread calls \texttt{serverSocket.close()}. This triggers a \texttt{SocketException} at the main thread, which is calling \texttt{serverSocket.accept()}. The exception is caught, which will execute \texttt{shutdown()} on the executor-service. After that, all tasks are finished and the executor-service shuts down. This also ends the main server thread.\\
    
    \subsection*{run part1)}
    
      To execute the first part, two classes have to be run:
      \begin{itemize}
    	\item[1.] Run the main method of \texttt{MultithreadedSortingServer.java}
    	\item[2.] Run the main method of \texttt{SimpleClientExecutor.java}
      \end{itemize}
